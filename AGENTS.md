# opencode-config — Repository Overview

This repository (`ada-x64/opencode-config`) is the opencode configuration for
this workstation. It defines AI models, operation modes, subagent personas,
skill libraries, and bash permission policies that govern every agent session.

Source templates live in `src/`. The build system stamps them with model
assignments and environment-specific values, producing deployable output in
`out/`. The output is then installed to `~/.config/opencode` (or a custom
`CONFIG_DIR`), where opencode loads it at startup.

> For build system internals, CI, Docker sandbox, and contributor conventions,
> see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Modes

Modes are interactive session contexts. Switch between them with the **Tab key**
in the opencode TUI. Each mode has its own system prompt and a distinct scope
of permitted actions.

| Mode      | Prompt file        | Purpose                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **build** | `prompts/build.md` | Full tool access — file edits, commands, subagent dispatch           |
| **plan**  | `prompts/plan.md`  | Read-only exploration and schema authoring; no direct file edits     |
| **audit** | `prompts/audit.md` | Read-only quality analysis — orchestrates `@auditor` and `@reviewer` |

### build mode

The default working mode. Has pre-approved `git add`, `git switch`,
`git checkout`; can dispatch any subagent. Commits and pushes always prompt
the user. Handles straightforward tasks directly; uses subagents for
structured workflow phases (plan → implement → review).

### plan mode

Restricted to reading and discussing. It cannot make file edits or run
state-mutating commands directly. Designed for the planning phase: explore
a codebase, discuss design, dispatch `@planner` to write a schema. When ready
to implement, the user switches to build mode (Tab).

### audit mode

Orchestrator for quality analysis. Does not run static analysis tools itself —
that is `@auditor`'s job. Clarifies scope with the user, dispatches
`@auditor`, and may additionally dispatch `@reviewer` for targeted diff
reviews. Does not modify repositories or create commits.

---

## Agents

Subagents are dispatched from within a session using the **Task tool**
(`@agentname`). Each agent is a Markdown file in `src/agents/` with a YAML
frontmatter block that declares its permissions, followed by its system prompt.

### Workflow roles

The eight agents map to distinct phases of the development workflow:

```
Research ──► Plan ──────► Implement ──────► Review
  @investigate @planner    @implementor       @reviewer
               @project-manager               @designer  (design docs)
                                              @auditor (quality audits)
```

### Agent reference

#### `@planner` — schema authoring

- **File:** `src/agents/planner.md`
- **Role:** Explores a codebase, discusses design with the user, writes an
  implementation schema to `$AGENT_VAULT/tasks/<task>/schema.md`,
  creates a GitHub issue, and links it into the schema.
- **Write access:** Full vault mutations (schemas and drafts); GitHub issue
  creation and project board adds (both require user approval via `ask`);
  `gh pr comment*` (ask — to cross-reference PRs when creating a related issue).
- **Post-schema:** Archives source drafts from `$AGENT_VAULT/drafts/` to `$AGENT_VAULT/_misc/archive/` with a date prefix.
- **Does not:** Implement anything; write outside the vault.

#### `@project-manager` — issue lifecycle and project board

- **File:** `src/agents/project-manager.md`
- **Role:** Keeps GitHub project state and vault task state synchronized. Closes
  completed issues, manages milestones, moves project board items, maintains
  `$AGENT_VAULT/projects/<owner>/<repo>.md` status documents, and runs
  `vault_gc`/`vault_lint` as part of project cleanup.
- **Write access:** All `gh issue *`, `gh project *`, `gh label *`, and
  `gh api repos/*/milestones` mutations; `gh pr comment*`; `vault_gc` and
  `vault_lint` tools.
- **Does not:** Edit source files; run any git write command; merge or close PRs;
  create or delete repositories; operate on repos not in the vault.

#### `@implementor` — manual schema execution

- **File:** `src/agents/implementor.md`
- **Role:** Executes a schema commit-group by commit-group, **pausing after
  each group** for user review before proceeding. Reads `CONTRIBUTING.md` at
  startup to learn project conventions. On startup: applies `in-progress` label
  and posts a start comment on the linked GitHub issue. On completion: removes
  `in-progress` label and posts a completion comment.
- **Write access:** Full repository edits, `git add`, `git switch`,
  `git checkout`, build/test tools, `gh issue edit`/`comment`. Uses custom tools
  for frontmatter (`fm_read`/`fm_write`), worktree ops (`wt_detect`/`wt_switch_branch`),
  notifications (`notify_triage`/`triage_dashboard`), and issue creation (`create_issue`).
- **Does not:** `git commit` (the user does that); push; skip approval gates.

#### `auto-impl` skill — autonomous schema execution

- **File:** `src/skills/auto-impl/SKILL.md`
- **Role:** A skill loaded by build mode that turns it into an autonomous
  orchestrator. Dispatches `@implementor` and `@reviewer` as first-level
  subagents. After each commit group it stages, commits, then runs a bounded
  review loop (max 3 rounds of `@reviewer`). Escalations are recorded via
  the vault-triage skill. Sends push notifications at key milestones.
- **Permissions:** Inherits build mode's permissions. Never pushes to remote.
- **Review loop:** After each commit, up to 3 review rounds. If high+ findings
  persist after round 3, escalates and continues.

#### `@reviewer` — structured code review

- **File:** `src/agents/reviewer.md`
- **Role:** Reviews staged changes (`git diff --cached`) or the latest commit
  (`git show HEAD`). Every finding is tagged with severity
  (`nit/low/medium/high/critical`) and category
  (`bug/performance/design/types/maintenance/security/docs/testing/style`).
  Writes the structured review to `$AGENT_VAULT/tasks/<task>/reviews/review.md`.
- **Write access:** Write tool (for review file); `fm_read`/`fm_write`; can run
  the test/lint suite for verification.
- **Does not:** Run build tools; create PRs or issues; write outside the review file.

#### `@designer` — design documents

- **File:** `src/agents/designer.md`
- **Role:** Explores repositories and produces design documents:
  - Design documents at `$AGENT_VAULT/designs/`
  - Work-in-progress drafts at `$AGENT_VAULT/drafts/`
- **Write access:** Full vault mutations (`vault_write`, `vault_edit`, `vault_mv`, `vault_rm`).
- **Does not:** Write to `notes/` (use `@investigate`); write schemas or reviews; run build tools; mutate git state.

#### `@auditor` — headless quality audit

- **File:** `src/agents/auditor.md`
- **Role:** Detects project language, runs all available static analysis tools
  (degrading gracefully when tools are absent), synthesises findings across
  Security/Testing/Architecture/Performance/Maintenance, and writes a structured
  audit report to `$AGENT_VAULT/audits/<owner>/<repo>/<date>-<label>.md`.
- **Write access:** Write tool and `yq`; a full suite of static analysis tools
  (Rust, Node, Python, cross-language).
- **Does not:** Run build/install tools; modify the repository; commit; push.

#### `@investigate` — deep research with provenance tracking

- **File:** `src/agents/investigate.md`
- **Role:** Conducts deep research on a repository and produces per-topic
  provenance-tracked reference notes at `$AGENT_VAULT/notes/<owner>/<repo>/`.
  Each note includes a `commit` SHA, `date`, and `sources` list in frontmatter
  for staleness detection. Can fetch online documentation via `webfetch` and `curl`.
- **Write access:** Write/Edit tools (for repo-notes and drafts), `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`
  (vault filesystem), `curl` (for web research and triage notifications).
- **Does not:** Write to `designs/`; write schemas or reviews; run build tools;
  mutate git state; dispatch subagents (leaf agent).

### Permission model

All agents use a **deny-override** pattern: the bash permission block opens
with `"*": deny` and then explicitly allows only the commands the agent needs.
This is the opposite of the global `opencode.json` list, which grants a wide
read-only baseline. The deny-override makes each agent's capabilities
independently auditable without cross-referencing the global config.

**Orchestrators vs. leaf agents:** `@planner` carries `task: allow` and may
dispatch subagents. All other agents (`@implementor`, `@project-manager`,
`@reviewer`, `@designer`, `@investigate`, `@auditor`) are **leaf agents** —
they have no `task:` permission and cannot spawn further subagents. The `auto-impl`
skill gives build mode autonomous orchestration capabilities (dispatching
`@implementor` and `@reviewer`) when loaded.

For full details — including the complete read-only baseline, the per-agent
write permission table, file-system scope restrictions, and instructions for
adding a new agent — see the vault note:

> `notes/ada-x64/opencode-config/agent-permissions.md`

---

## Skills

Skills are **loadable instruction sets** injected into context on demand. They
are not loaded automatically — an agent uses the `skill` tool (or follows a
human prompt) to load one. Each skill lives in `src/skills/<name>/` with a
`SKILL.md` descriptor and optional helper scripts.

### How to load a skill

In any agent session, call the `skill` tool with the skill name:

```
skill("vault-triage")
```

The skill injects its `SKILL.md` content into the conversation, providing
detailed instructions and references to bundled scripts.

### Available skills

| Skill            | Directory                    | Purpose                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auto-impl`      | `src/skills/auto-impl/`      | Autonomous schema execution — turns build mode into an orchestrator                   |
| `delegate`       | `src/skills/delegate/`       | Spawn AoE sessions for parallel agent work                                            |
| `research-check` | `src/skills/research-check/` | Check notes freshness against current repo state; outputs structured staleness report |
| `vault-init`     | `src/skills/vault-init/`     | Initialize or verify the vault directory structure; use the `vault_init` tool         |
| `vault-triage`   | `src/skills/vault-triage/`   | Write triage entries, send push notifications, regenerate the inbox                   |

Six lookup skills (`archive`, `notes`, `reviews`, `schemas`,
`vault`) have been replaced by the `vault_find` tool. Five tool-only skills
(`gh-helpers`, `local-ci`, `vault-cache`, `vault-gc`, `vault-lint`) have been
removed — their tools (`create_issue`, `create_pr`, `local_ci`, `vault_cache`,
`vault_gc`, `vault_lint`) are used directly.

### Tools

All custom tools are TypeScript files in `src/tools/`, organized by domain
into subdirectories (`fm/`, `wt/`, `notify/`, `triage/`, `vault/`). Each
subdirectory has a barrel export and a `_lib.ts` for shared helpers. Agents
call tools directly — there are no shell scripts to invoke.

| Domain      | Tools                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontmatter | `fm_read`, `fm_write`                                                                                                                              |
| Worktree    | `wt_detect`, `wt_owner_repo`, `wt_switch_branch`, `wt_cleanup`                                                                                     |
| Notify      | `notify_triage`, `session_notify`                                                                                                                  |
| Triage      | `triage_dashboard`, `triage_write`                                                                                                                 |
| Vault       | `vault_cache`, `vault_edit`, `vault_find`, `vault_gc`, `vault_init`, `vault_lint`, `vault_ls`, `vault_mv`, `vault_read`, `vault_rm`, `vault_write` |
| GitHub      | `create_issue`, `create_pr`                                                                                                                        |
| Other       | `delegate`, `local_ci`                                                                                                                             |

## Vault Integration

Agent work products (schemas, reviews, triage entries, audit reports, repo
notes, design documents) live in a **separate Obsidian vault** — not in this
repo. The vault is a git-tracked directory managed with Obsidian.

### Vault directory layout

```
$AGENT_VAULT/
├── tasks/
│   └── <task>/
│       ├── schema.md         # Implementation spec

├── triage-inbox.md           # Generated triage dashboard
└── AGENTS.md                 # Vault conventions document
```

### Vault access pattern

The vault is a plain directory of Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Agents
access it through dedicated vault I/O tools that accept paths relative to
`$AGENT_VAULT`.

- **Read:** `vault_read` tool (scoped to vault; for repo files, use the built-in Read tool)
- **List/search:** `vault_ls` tool (directory listing and glob matching)
- **Create/modify:** `vault_write` (create/overwrite) and `vault_edit` (find-and-replace)
- **Frontmatter:** `fm_read` / `fm_write` custom tools
- **Move/rename:** `vault_mv` tool
- **Delete:** `vault_rm` tool (files only; use `vault_gc` for bulk cleanup)
- **Specialized:** `vault_gc`, `vault_lint`, `triage_dashboard`, etc. (unchanged)

### Initializing the vault

If `$AGENT_VAULT` is unset or the vault directory is missing, load the
`vault-init` skill and run:

```
vault_init({})
```

The tool (and the underlying script) is idempotent and safe to run multiple times.

## Workflow Phases

All non-trivial implementation work follows three sequential phases:

### Phase 1 — Plan

**Mode:** plan (or build mode via `@planner`)
**Agent:** `@planner`
**Output:** `$AGENT_VAULT/tasks/<task>/schema.md`, GitHub issue

The planner explores the codebase, discusses design with the user, and writes
a schema. The schema is a fully self-contained actionable spec organized into
commit groups (each with sub-tasks and a validation step). The planner stops
after writing the schema and waits for user approval before creating the issue.

### Phase 2 — Implement

**Mode:** build
**Agent:** `@implementor` (manual) or `auto-impl` skill (autonomous)

Choose based on how much oversight is needed:

- `@implementor` — pauses after each commit group; the user reviews and says
  "continue". Good for unfamiliar codebases, risky changes, or when the user
  wants granular control.
- `auto-impl` skill — build mode loads the skill and runs end-to-end; uses a
  bounded review loop per commit group; escalates persistent problems via the
  vault-triage skill. Good for well-specified schemas in repos with good test
  coverage.

### Phase 3 — Review

**Mode:** build (or triggered automatically by the `auto-impl` skill)
**Agent:** `@reviewer`

The reviewer examines staged changes or the latest commit and writes a
structured finding list with per-finding severity and category. In manual
mode the user explicitly requests the review; in auto mode the implementor
dispatches it automatically after each commit.

## Bare Repo / Worktree Convention

Repositories under `$AGENT_REPOS` may use a **bare repo + worktree** layout
instead of a traditional `git clone`. This is the preferred repository format.

### Layout

```
$AGENT_REPOS/<owner>/<repo>/
├── .bare/                # Bare git repository (objects, refs, etc.)
├── .git                  # File containing "gitdir: .bare"
├── main/                 # Worktree for the main branch
├── feat/my-feature/      # Worktree for a feature branch
└── fix/bug-123/          # Worktree for a bugfix branch
```

Each branch lives in its own worktree directory. The `.git` at the repo root
is a **file** (not a directory) that points to `.bare`.

### Detection

Agents detect repo type by checking `.git`:

| `.git` is a…                              | Repo type  | Meaning                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Directory**                             | `clone`    | Traditional `git clone`                  |
| **File**                                  | `worktree` | Git worktree (part of a bare repo setup) |
| **Absent** (but `HEAD` + `refs/` present) | `bare`     | Bare repository root                     |
| **Absent**                                | `unknown`  | Not a git repository                     |

### Worktree tools

Four custom tools handle all worktree operations. Agents call the tools
directly — there is no shell library to source.

| Function           | Custom tool        | Behaviour                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `wt_detect`        | `wt_detect`        | Prints `clone`, `worktree`, `bare`, or `unknown`                                                 |
| `wt_owner_repo`    | `wt_owner_repo`    | Prints `<owner>/<repo>` — always 2 path components after `$AGENT_REPOS`, regardless of depth     |
| `wt_switch_branch` | `wt_switch_branch` | Creates a new worktree (bare setup) or `git switch` (clone). Returns the working directory path. |
| `wt_cleanup`       | `wt_cleanup`       | Removes a worktree. Best-effort, never fails the caller.                                         |

**Tool invocation** (preferred):

```
wt_detect({ path: "/home/user/repos/owner/repo/main" })
wt_switch_branch({ repo_path: "/home/user/repos/owner/repo/main", branch: "feat/my-feature" })
```

### Key rules for agents

1. **Always detect** — run `wt_detect` or check `.git` at startup when
   operating on a repository. Never assume a traditional clone.
2. **Use `wt_owner_repo`** for `<owner>/<repo>` derivation — never manually
   strip `$AGENT_REPOS/` with `sed`, as that breaks for worktree paths.
3. **Use `wt_switch_branch`** instead of `git switch` for branch operations.
   In a worktree setup this creates a new worktree at
   `<bare_root>/<branch>` and returns the new path. The caller must
   reassign: `repo_path="$(wt_switch_branch "$repo_path" "$branch")"`.
4. **One branch per worktree** — never use `git switch` inside a worktree
   to change its branch. Each worktree is pinned to one branch.
5. **Cleanup after merge** — after a branch is merged, the worktree can be
   removed with `wt_cleanup <path>`. Agents should suggest this to the user
   but never run it automatically.

### Permissions

With the custom tool conversion, worktree bash permissions (`source
*/lib/worktree.sh*`, `wt_detect *`, `wt_owner_repo *`, `wt_switch_branch *`,
`wt_cleanup *`) have been removed from agent permission files. Custom tools
execute via Bun and bypass bash permissions entirely.

Remaining bash permissions for worktree operations:

- All agents: `"git worktree list*": allow` (read-only)
- `@implementor`: additionally `"git worktree add*": allow` and `"git worktree remove*": allow`

## PR-Issue cross-reference

When an agent creates a GitHub issue that relates to an open PR, it must
immediately post a comment on the PR using the format:

```
Opened #<number> to track <short description>.
```

This applies to `@planner` (ask) and `@project-manager` (allow). The
`auto-impl` skill also posts cross-reference comments when escalations create
issues. `@reviewer` does not create issues and is therefore exempt.

```bash
gh pr comment <pr-number> -R <owner>/<repo> --body "Opened #<issue-number> to track <short description>."
```

---

## Reading remote source code

When a repository is not cloned locally (not under `$AGENT_REPOS`), use the
GitHub API to browse it:

```bash
# List all files in a branch
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/trees/<branch>?recursive=1 -q '.tree[].path'

# Fetch a specific file
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/<path> -q .content | base64 -d
```

---

## Notifications

Push notifications to phone/desktop are sent via ntfy.sh. The `notify_triage`
custom tool handles icon URL construction, emoji resolution, and topic
fallback. The `icon` parameter is the agent or skill icon name (e.g.
`"implementor"`, `"reviewer"`, `"auto-implementor"`) and the optional `emoji`
parameter resolves to an emoji prefix (e.g. `"clean"` → 🟢, `"escalation"`
→ ❗). When the icon starts with `auto-` (e.g. `"auto-implementor"`), the tool
strips the prefix for the PNG URL and prepends ⚙️ to the emoji automatically.
Full key table in `src/skills/vault-triage/SKILL.md`.

```
notify_triage({
  type: "activity",
  task: "owner/repo/task",
  headline: "Commit Group 2 Complete",
  body: "• All tests passing",
  icon: "auto-implementor",
  emoji: "activity"
})

notify_triage({
  type: "escalation",
  task: "owner/repo/task",
  headline: "Review Loop Exhausted on Group 3",
  body: "• High findings persist",
  icon: "auto-implementor",
  emoji: "escalation"
})
```

All 7 agents (and the `auto-impl` skill) load the `vault-triage` skill after
completing significant work, write a triage entry, send a notification (via
`notify_triage` tool), and regenerate the inbox (via `triage_dashboard` tool).
These three post-work steps are mandatory — see the skill's Overview section.

Notification priorities: escalation/design-question → high (audible);
activity/handoff → default (non-audible); run-summary → low (silent). All
calls fail silently if ntfy is not configured, so they never block agent work.

## Environment Variable Reference

| Variable             | Required            | Description                           | Fallback                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `AGENT_VAULT`        | Yes (for vault ops) | Absolute path to the Obsidian vault   | None — must be set                  |
| `AGENT_REPOS`        | Yes (for repo ops)  | Absolute path to local repo checkouts | None — must be set                  |
| `NTFY_TOPIC`         | No                  | ntfy.sh topic for push notifications  | `$AGENT_VAULT/_misc/ntfy-topic.txt` |
| `SANDBOX_CONFIG_DIR` | No                  | Path where sandbox config is deployed | `$HOME/.config/opencode-sandbox`    |

`AGENT_VAULT` and `AGENT_REPOS` are checked at the top of any agent session
that uses the vault or operates on a repository. The `vault-init` skill can
create and populate the vault directory if it does not yet exist.
