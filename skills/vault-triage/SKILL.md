# Vault Triage Skill

## Overview

Every agent loads this skill after completing significant work. The three
post-work steps are **mandatory** — skipping notify or inbox update is a
protocol violation:

1. **Write** a triage entry to the task directory
2. **Send** a push notification via `notify_triage`
3. **Regenerate** the triage inbox via `triage-dashboard.sh`

This skill applies in **Write Mode** (after completing work) and **Report Mode**
(when summarising pending triage items for human review).

---

## Write Mode

Follow these steps in order after completing significant work:

### Step 1 — Source the notification helper

```bash
source ~/.config/opencode/skills/vault-triage/notify.sh 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 2 — Confirm AGENT_VAULT is set

```bash
echo "${AGENT_VAULT:?AGENT_VAULT must be set}"
```

### Step 3 — Determine the task directory

```bash
task_dir="$AGENT_VAULT/tasks/<owner>/<repo>/<task>/"
```

If no task context exists (e.g. designer writing repo notes, auto-auditor
running a standalone audit), use the agent-specific fallback:

- `@designer` → `$AGENT_VAULT/tasks/_activity/designer/`
- `@auto-auditor` → `$AGENT_VAULT/tasks/_activity/auto-auditor/`
- `@project-manager` → `$AGENT_VAULT/tasks/_activity/project-manager/`

Create the directory if it does not exist:

```bash
mkdir -p "$task_dir"
```

### Step 4 — Find the next available filename

```bash
find "$task_dir" -name "triage*.md" | sort
```

- If no files exist → use `triage.md`
- If `triage.md` exists but not `triage-2.md` → use `triage-2.md`
- Continue incrementing: `triage-3.md`, `triage-4.md`, etc.

### Step 5 — Read the format template

```bash
cat "$AGENT_VAULT/templates/triage.md"
```

### Step 6 — Write the triage entry

Use the Write tool. Follow the frontmatter format and body structure for the
entry type (see **Entry Types** below). Set `status: pending`.

### Step 7 — MANDATORY: Send notification

```bash
notify_triage "<type>" "<owner>/<repo>/<task>" "<one-line summary>"
```

This is not optional. Failing to notify means the human has no real-time
awareness of completed work. The function fails silently if ntfy is not
configured — it will never block your work.

### Step 8 — MANDATORY: Regenerate inbox

```bash
bash ~/.config/opencode/skills/vault-triage/triage-dashboard.sh
```

This is not optional. The triage inbox must always reflect the current
state of the vault after every write.

## Entry Types

### `activity` — routine work completion

**When:** After any significant completed work (schema written, review done,
audit complete, implementation commit group finished, project sync done, etc.)

**Format:** Brief — 2-3 sentences:
- What the agent did
- The outcome / result
- Next steps (if any)

**Example:**
```yaml
---
type: activity
agent: reviewer
task: my-task
date: 2026-03-31
status: pending
---

Completed code review of commit group 2. Found 3 nits and 1 medium finding
(missing error handling in retry loop). Implementor should address the medium
finding before proceeding to group 3.
```

---

### `escalation` — review loop exhausted / agent stuck

**When:** After 3 review rounds with high+ findings persisting, or any time
the agent is blocked and cannot proceed without human input.

**Format:** Detailed — must include:
- **Diagnosis** — one of: `implementation-gap`, `schema-ambiguity`,
  `design-contradiction`, `underspecified-requirement`
- **Persistent findings** — verbatim from the last review
- **What was tried** — summary of fix attempts across all rounds
- **Recommendation** — suggested human action

**Example:**
```yaml
---
type: escalation
agent: auto-implementor
task: my-task
date: 2026-03-31
status: pending
---

## Diagnosis: schema-ambiguity

## Persistent Findings (Round 3)

- [high/design] The retry logic in `src/client.rs` does not handle the
  `ConnectionReset` variant — this was flagged in all 3 review rounds.

## What Was Tried

- Round 1: Added `ConnectionReset` to the retry match arm.
- Round 2: Reviewer flagged that the fix introduced a loop without backoff.
- Round 3: Added exponential backoff; reviewer flagged missing test coverage
  for the backoff path, which requires integration test infrastructure not
  present in this repo.

## Recommendation

Human should decide whether to add integration test infrastructure or accept
the backoff logic without coverage. Schema §2c is underspecified on this point.
```

---

### `design-question` — ambiguity resolved with judgment call

**When:** A genuine design ambiguity was encountered during implementation and
a non-trivial judgment call was made that the schema did not resolve.

**Format:** Detailed — must include:
- **Decision point** — the specific ambiguity encountered
- **Options considered** — list of options evaluated
- **Why the agent couldn't resolve autonomously** — what was unclear
- **Choice made and rationale** — what was chosen and why
- **Recommendation for human review** — whether the choice should be revisited

---

### `run-summary` — end-of-run summary (auto-implementor only)

**When:** At completion of a full autonomous implementation run.

**Format:** Comprehensive — must include:
- Commit groups completed (list with validation results)
- Total review rounds
- Escalations filed (filenames or "none")
- Design decisions made (or "none")
- Unresolved nit/low findings

---

### `handoff` — context transfer

**When:** Work is interrupted mid-run and the next agent or human needs
context to continue.

**Format:** Clear and complete — must include:
- Last completed work
- What remains
- Any context the next agent/human needs to pick up cleanly

## Notification Events by Agent Role

| Agent | Events | Type |
|-------|--------|------|
| `@planner` | Schema written; Issue created | `activity` |
| `@reviewer` | Review completed (include finding counts + max severity) | `activity` |
| `@designer` | Repo notes or design document written | `activity` |
| `@implementor` | Commit group completed; Full implementation complete | `activity` |
| `@auto-implementor` | Review loop exhausted | `escalation` |
| `@auto-implementor` | Design ambiguity resolved | `design-question` |
| `@auto-implementor` | Run complete | `run-summary` |
| `@auto-implementor` | Commit group completed | `activity` |
| `@auto-auditor` | Audit report completed (include critical/high counts) | `activity` |
| `@project-manager` | Bulk operations completed; Vault cleanup; Project sync | `activity` |

---

## Report Mode

To read triage files and generate a summary of pending items:

1. Collect all triage files in scope:
   ```bash
   find "$AGENT_VAULT/tasks/<owner>/<repo>/" -name "triage*.md" | sort
   ```
   Or across the entire vault:
   ```bash
   find "$AGENT_VAULT/tasks/" -name "triage*.md" | sort
   ```

2. Read each file and extract frontmatter fields:
   ```bash
   yq --front-matter=extract '.type, .status, .date, .agent' "$file"
   ```

3. Group by type. Filter to `status: pending` by default (unless the human
   asks for addressed or dismissed items too).

4. Produce a Markdown summary grouped by type:
   - **Escalations** (action required — highest priority)
   - **Design questions** (human judgment needed)
   - **Handoffs** (pick up where agent left off)
   - **Run summaries** (review at leisure)
   - **Activity** (FYI — no action required)

## How to Invoke (Dashboard and Notifications)

### Generate the dashboard

```bash
# Regenerate triage-inbox.md
bash ~/.config/opencode/skills/vault-triage/triage-dashboard.sh

# Send a summary notification instead of regenerating
bash ~/.config/opencode/skills/vault-triage/triage-dashboard.sh --notify-summary
```

### Send a notification manually

```bash
source ~/.config/opencode/skills/vault-triage/notify.sh
notify_triage escalation "ada-x64/qproj/fix-tests" "Review loop exhausted on commit group 2"
notify_triage activity "ada-x64/qproj/fix-tests" "Commit group 1 complete — all tests passing"
```

### First-time setup

> **Note:** `setup.sh` is shipped separately. Run once after the full skill is installed.

```bash
bash ~/.config/opencode/skills/vault-triage/setup.sh
```
