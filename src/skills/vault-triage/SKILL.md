# Vault Triage Skill

## Overview

Every agent loads this skill after completing significant work. The three
post-work steps are **mandatory** — skipping notify or inbox update is a
protocol violation:

1. **Write** a triage entry:
   ```
   triage_write({ type: "<type>", task: "<owner>/<repo>/<task>", agent: "<agent>", headline: "<headline>", body: "<body>" })
   ```
2. **Send** a push notification:
   ```
   notify_triage({ type: "<type>", task: "<owner>/<repo>/<task>", headline: "<headline>", body: "<body>", icon: "<icon>", emoji: "<semantic-key>" })
   ```
3. **Regenerate** the triage inbox:
   ```
   triage_dashboard({})
   ```

> **First-time setup:** Run `bash "$OPENCODE_CONFIG_SRC/skills/vault-triage/setup.sh"` once after install.

## Reference: Notification icons and emoji keys

### Icon names (per agent / mode)

Pass as the `icon` parameter to `notify_triage`. The icon name maps to a PNG served
from the opencode-config repo.

| Agent / Mode        | Icon argument      |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| `@implementor`      | `implementor`      |
| `auto-impl` skill      | `auto-implementor` |
| `@auto-auditor`     | `auto-auditor`     |
| Audit mode          | `auditor`          |
| `@reviewer`         | `reviewer`         |
| `@planner`          | `planner`          |
| `@designer`         | `designer`         |
| `@project-manager`  | `project-manager`  |
| Build mode          | `build`            |
| Plan mode           | `plan`             |
| Fallback            | `default`          |

### Semantic keys (`emoji` parameter — emoji resolution)

Pass a semantic key as the `emoji` parameter. The tool resolves it to the
correct emoji. **Always use semantic keys** — they are readable and their
mappings are centrally managed. Unknown keys are ignored and fall back to the
type-based default emoji.

#### Type-based defaults (when `emoji` is omitted)

| Triage type       | Emoji |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| `escalation`      | ❗    |
| `design-question` | ❓    |
| `activity`        | 📋    |
| `handoff`         | 📋    |
| `run-summary`     | 📋    |

#### Explicit semantic keys

| Key               | Emoji | Used when                               |
| ----------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| `activity`        | 📋    | General work completion                 |
| `clean`           | 🟢    | Review/audit: 0 high+ findings          |
| `warn`            | 🟡    | Review/audit: nit/low findings only     |
| `reject`          | 🔴    | Review/audit: high or critical findings |
| `escalation`      | ❗    | Review loop exhausted or blocking issue |
| `design-question` | ❓    | Design ambiguity needing human input    |

**Auto-agent prefix:** When the `icon` parameter starts with `auto-` (e.g.
`"auto-implementor"`), `notify.sh` strips the prefix for the PNG URL lookup
and prepends ⚙️ to the resolved emoji. Agents do not use separate `auto-*`
semantic keys — the ⚙️ prefix is derived automatically from the agent name.

## Entry Types

### `activity` — routine work completion

**When:** After any significant completed work (schema written, review done,
audit complete, implementation commit group finished, project sync done, etc.)

**Format:** Brief — 2-3 sentences:

- What the agent did
- The outcome / result
- Next steps (if any)

---

### `escalation` — review loop exhausted / agent stuck

**When:** After 3 review rounds with high+ findings persisting, or any time
the agent is blocked and cannot proceed without human input.

**Format:** Detailed — must include:

- **Diagnosis** — one of: `implementation-gap`, `schema-ambiguity`,
  `design-contradiction`, `underspecified-requirement`
- **Persistent findings** — verbatim from the last review
- **What was tried** — summary of fix attempts across all rounds
- **Recommendation** — suggested human action

---

### `design-question` — ambiguity resolved with judgment call

**When:** A genuine design ambiguity was encountered during implementation and
a non-trivial judgment call was made that the schema did not resolve.

**Format:** Detailed — must include:

- **Decision point** — the specific ambiguity encountered
- **Options considered** — list of options evaluated
- **Why the agent couldn't resolve autonomously** — what was unclear
- **Choice made and rationale** — what was chosen and why
- **Recommendation for human review** — whether the choice should be revisited

---

### `run-summary` — end-of-run summary

**When:** At completion of a full autonomous implementation run.

**Format:** Comprehensive — must include:

- Commit groups completed (list with validation results)
- Total review rounds
- Escalations filed (filenames or "none")
- Design decisions made (or "none")
- Unresolved nit/low findings

---

### `handoff` — context transfer

**When:** Work is interrupted mid-run and the next agent or human needs
context to continue.

**Format:** Clear and complete — must include:

- Last completed work
- What remains
- Any context the next agent/human needs to pick up cleanly

## Report Mode

To read triage files and generate a summary of pending items:

1. Collect all triage files in scope using `vault_find`:

   ```
   vault_find({ section: "triage" })
   vault_find({ section: "triage", repo: "ada-x64/opencode-config" })
   ```

2. Read each file and extract frontmatter fields using the `fm_read` tool:

   ```
   fm_read({ file: "<path>", key: "type", default_value: "unknown" })
   fm_read({ file: "<path>", key: "status", default_value: "unknown" })
   fm_read({ file: "<path>", key: "date", default_value: "unknown" })
   fm_read({ file: "<path>", key: "agent", default_value: "unknown" })
   ```

3. Group by type. Filter to `status: pending` by default (unless the human
   asks for addressed or dismissed items too).

4. Produce a Markdown summary grouped by type:
   - **Escalations** (action required — highest priority)
   - **Design questions** (human judgment needed)
   - **Handoffs** (pick up where agent left off)
   - **Run summaries** (review at leisure)
   - **Activity** (FYI — no action required)
